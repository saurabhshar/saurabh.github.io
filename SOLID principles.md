The SOLID principles are a set of design principles for object-oriented programming that aim to make software systems more maintainable, flexible, and scalable:

S - Single Responsibility Principle  
O - Open/Closed Principle  
L - Liskov Substitution Principle    
I - Interface Segregation Principle  
D - Dependency Inversion Principle  

Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design and helps developers create more robust and extensible systems.

* Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or job within the system. This principle helps keep classes focused, maintainable, and easy to understand.

* Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without having to modify existing code. This principle helps prevent unintentional side effects when making changes to a system.

* Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types, meaning that you should be able to use a subclass wherever its parent class is expected without causing any errors or unexpected behavior. This principle helps ensure that objects in a system behave consistently and can be easily replaced or extended.

* Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. This principle suggests that interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific ones so that clients can implement only what they need. This helps reduce complexity and coupling in a system.

* Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This principle suggests that you should depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. This helps create more flexible and modular systems that are easier to test and maintain.
